## Asteroids-Android-App
## Synopsis

Have you ever wondered what is floating above our heads? No I'm not talking about birds, planes or Superman. I'm talking about comets, meteorites
and other space debris. This app tells you what objects are near Earth today and it also tells you whether the object is hazardous or not.
So get out your telescopes, open this app and see how many objects you can find. 

## Code

This project relies heavily on NASA's NEO(near earth objects) API, as all the information for this project is extracted from there. It also uses 
NASA's APOD( astronomy picture of the day) API to show the user what the picture of the day is.
